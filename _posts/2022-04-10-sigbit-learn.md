We have started a [curated learning library](https://sigbit.org/learn/) and will keep on adding high quality learning materials on SIGBIT related topics. 

Please create [an issue](https://github.com/ais-sigbit/learn/issues) with new learning materials you think we should add.

We are looking forward to your contributions! Thanks a lot!
