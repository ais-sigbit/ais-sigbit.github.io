									<strong>Track Description:</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									The information systems community  can make a significant contribution to the area of service science by  identifying the relevant theories and paradigms that can be brought to bear on  the creation, adoption and diffusion of services as well as developing methodologies  and tools for designing and implementing service systems in various domains. &nbsp;The  objective of this track is to encourage research in service science from a  fresh perspective of intelligent enrichment of services-based systems and  applications. For example, using the service oriented paradigm, one can create  data and knowledge services that can promote adaptability, reusability and  interoperability of services from a variety of sources. This track will provide  a forum for IS academics and practitioners in related fields such as  information systems, distributed AI, intelligent agents, and collaborative  work, to identify and explore the issues, opportunities, and solutions that  improve service systems, particularly from the view point of increased use of semantics  to enhance services. In other words, in the era of Service Oriented  Architecture (SOA), Web Services, and Semantic Web where adaptivness, reuse-ability,  and interoperability are paramount, how can semantic enrichment of services be  taken to the next level using these technologies to achieve large scale  adoption and use of service systems?&nbsp; In  addition to the traditional issues related to the technical, managerial and  organizational aspects of service oriented systems, we seek papers that discuss  service delivery systems from the perspective of combining semantics with  services.
								</p>
								<p>
									Best papers from this track will be selected  and recommended for possible publication in the <em>International Journal of Intelligent Information Technologies</em> (IJIIT)
