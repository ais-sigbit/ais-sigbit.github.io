									<strong>Track Description:</strong>
								</p>
								<p align="left">
									Social networks have always played an important role in business processes and services by connecting people together. With the emergence of online social networking tools such as social networking sites, blogging, instant messaging, wikis, and online forums, this role has become even more important than before. For instance, business processes can be expedited through online chatting; services can be provided to customers through social network channels; and business process management can be influenced by the structural efficiency of social networks and communities. There are considerable opportunities for researchers to study the theories, artifact design, and applications related to the interwoven relationship between social networks and business processes and services. This track seeks to draw researchers and practitioners together to discuss the latest research and practice in this area. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
									<br>
									<br>
									* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Business process in social networks
									<br>
									* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Business value of social networks
									<br>
									* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Communication and collaboration in process management and services
									<br>
									* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Design and evaluation of social networking tools and algorithms
									<br>
									* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Discovery of service innovations using social network analysis
