									<strong>Track Description:</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									Studies on innovative software development  approaches such as open source software (OSS) development have proliferated in  recent years as OSS becomes a major approach to software development supported  by prestigious companies including IBM. Recently, community source, defined as an  open source project that requires significant investments from institutional  partners in both human resources and cash contributions has emerged as a new  model of open source development. As more and more organizations adopt innovative  (including community source) approaches for software development, it is  important for us to enhance our understanding on the opportunities and  challenges that are brought by these emerging trends. This track is aimed to provide  a forum for discussions of managerial issues in innovative software  development. We welcome original research that contributions to the economical,  empirical, practical, and theoretical aspects of innovative software development  models and processes. Possible topics include, but are not limited to:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										New  innovative software development initiatives and trends
									</li>
									<li>
										Best  practices in innovative software development
									</li>
