									Choosing appropriate information services is important for organizations to develop the IT capability to support their business. Information service has experienced the transformation from ASP (Application Service Provider)? model to SaaS (Software as a Service) model and next to nowadays Cloud Computing Service model. Cloud computing is an open information service, which enables ubiquitous, convenient, and on-demand network access to a shared pool of computing resources with minimal management effort, provider-user interactions and time. At the vendor side, the leading IT companies, e.g., IBM, have transformed their core business by moving from IT as a product to IT as a service. Cloud computing service indicates a new trend of information service with the underpinning of IT. At the organizational user side, ?“Open information service” requires the subscribing organizations to turn inside information and other related resources out. Consider any proactive organization as an open system, the cloud computing enabled open information service should exactly fit to their desirability for external connectivity with efficiency. On the other hand, the risks such as contractual hazard, information security, etc., may also bring disasters to the subscribing organizations. Thus, to align with the transforming information service, how organizations respond to new trend of information service for organizations is an important theme for research. This topic is also in line with the ICIS2012 theme of “Digital Innovation in the Service Economy”.
