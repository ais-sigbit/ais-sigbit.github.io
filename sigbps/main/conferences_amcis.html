										Over the past 15 years attitudes toward business processes have changed significantly within organizations. What started with Total Quality Management initiatives and continued through Business Process Reengineering (BPR) projects of the early1990s has evolved into a comprehensive management practice that permeates both the business and the technology side of organizations. Business Process Management (BPM) can be defined as methods and tools surrounding the definition, implementation, and improvement of lateral processes in organizations. BPM tools and techniques play a significant role in both intra-organizational and inter-organizational process design. As BPM continues to gain importance in todayâ€™s organization, an increasing number of studies detail efficiency, effectiveness and agility improvements resulting from process management initiatives. Innovative industrial implementations and applications of BPM methods and techniques are of much interest today, given their potential for bringing significant gains to the enterprise through the automated coordination of activities, process participants and the integration of applications.
